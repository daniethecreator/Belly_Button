# Belly_Button
Challenge 12

The purpose of this challenge was to create an interactive webpage that a user could look at data for the selected ID. There was also a table included with demographic information in addition to the three charts, one for the top 10 bacteria cultures found, the number of times the belly button was washed, and the bacteria culters per sample.
